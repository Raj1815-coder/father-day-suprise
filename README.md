## About the Project
This is a small but meaningful project I created as a Father’s Day surprise.
It features a personalized letter expressing love and appreciation, along with a special interactive touch.

When the button is pressed, animated hearts pop up on the screen — adding a bit of fun, joy, and visual celebration to the message.

The goal was to combine heartfelt words with a playful moment to make Dad smile.
